# Proxy-Pointer MultiModal -- Answer with Visuals, not just text 🖼️

**MultiModal Retrieval without Multimodal Embeddings RAG Pipeline** — An extension of the Proxy-Pointer architecture that performs unified reasoning across text and graphics. It retrieves full document sections and automatically surfaces the associated figures, tables, and charts for multimodal synthesis.

## How It Works

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Multimodal Documents] -->|Adobe Extract| B[Markdown + Figures/Tables]
    B -->|Skeleton Tree Builder| C[Structure Trees w/ Image Anchors]
    C -->|LLM Noise Filter| D[Content Nodes]
    B --> E[Text Chunks]
    D --> E
    E -->|Gemini Embed 1536d| F[FAISS Index]

    G[User Query] -->|Gemini Embed| H[Vector Search k=200]
    F --> H
    H -->|Dedup by doc_id,node_id| I[Top 50 Unique Candidates]
    I -->|Semantic Re-Ranker w/ Snippets| J[Top 5 Finalist Nodes]
    J -->|Load Full Text + Image Paths| K[Rich Multimodal Context]
    K -->|Gemini 3.1 Synthesis| L[Grounded Answer + Visuals]
    L --> M[Streamlit UI Rendering]
```

Instead of retrieving small, context-less chunks, Proxy-Pointer MultiModal:

1. **Builds a structural tree** of each document, automatically mapping local image paths (figures/tables) to their specific parent sections.
2. **Filters noise** (TOC, abbreviations, etc.) using an LLM to ensure the re-ranker stays focused on technical content.
3. **Uses Semantic Snippets:** The re-ranker sees a 150-character preview of each section, allowing it to find technical topics (like "QK-Normalization") even if they aren't in the heading.
4. **Performs Anchor-Aware Retrieval:** If a query mentions "Figure 5" or "Table I", the system prioritizes sections that physically contain those anchors.
5. **Loads Full Multimodal Payloads:** The synthesizer sees the complete section text and the actual images paths, enabling high-fidelity "Visual Grounding" without using multimodal embeddings or a Vision model.

## 5-Minute Quickstart

A sample dataset containing five complex research papers (**CLIP, GaLore, NemoBot, VectorFusion, and VectorPainter**) is included. You just need to build the index and start querying.

### 1. Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Proxy-Pointer/Proxy-Pointer-RAG.git
cd Proxy-Pointer-RAG
cd MultiModal
```

### 2. Create virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
```

### 3. Install dependencies

From the repository root, install the multimodal extra:

```bash
pip install "pprag[multimodal]"
```

For local development inside this subproject, you can also use the migrated `pyproject.toml`:

```bash
uv sync --project MultiModal
```

### 4. Configure API keys
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env → add:
# 1. GOOGLE_API_KEY

```

### 5. Build the index
```bash
# This builds the FAISS index and structure trees for all 5 papers
python -m src.indexing.build_md_index --fresh
```

### 6. Start the UI
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
Try a query like:

```
User >> Tell me about the VectorPainter pipeline
or a more advanced comparative one:
User >> Compare GaLore's approach to memory efficiency with the standard Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) mentioned in generative model fine-tuning.
```

## Running Benchmarks

The MultiModal version includes an automated evaluation script that runs a 20-query technical suite across all 5 papers.

```bash
# Run the technical evaluation
python run_test_suite.py
```

## Adding Your Own Documents

### Option A: You already have processed folders
If you have folders containing `.md` files and associated images (e.g., from a previous extraction):
1. Place the folders inside `data/extracted_papers/`.
2. Run the indexer to process the new text and anchors:
   ```bash
   python -m src.indexing.build_md_index
   ```

### Option B: Start from PDFs
1. Add your `ADOBE_CLIENT_ID` and `ADOBE_CLIENT_SECRET` to your `.env` file.
2. Place your raw PDFs in `data/pdf/`.
3. Extract to vision-ready Markdown and Figures:
   ```bash
   # This uses Adobe Extract PDF API to generate MD + Image assets
   python -m src.extraction.extract_pdf
   ```
4. Build the index:
   ```bash
   python -m src.indexing.build_md_index
   ```

## Design Decisions

### Why Semantic Snippets?
Standard vector RAG returns chunks by embedding similarity. However, technical deep-dives (like "gradient projection" in the GaLore paper) are often buried in sections with generic headers like "Memory-Efficient Training". By giving the re-ranker a **Semantic Snippet** (first 150 chars), the LLM can identify the technical answer even when the header is unhelpful.

### Why Anchor-Aware Re-ranking?
Users often ask about specific "ghost anchors" (e.g., "What does Table 1 show?"). Since multiple papers might have a "Table 1," the re-ranker performs a structural sweep of all candidates to find the specific section that physically contains the anchor mentioned in the query.

### Why Full-Section Loading?
The indexed chunk is just a fragment. The synthesizer needs the **complete** section (including headers, full tables, and every associated image) for accurate multimodal synthesis. The chunk acts as a **pointer**; the full section + its images is the **payload**.
